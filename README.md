# Mode-Analytics-Case-study---Understanding-Search-functionality-in-Yammer
Understanding search

Case study is performed to understand whether the technical team in yammer should invest their time in improving the 
search functionality or not. A mode analytics report is generated and it displays the query results along with various charts 
to help yammer team make an informed decision.
*****************************************************************************************************
First Chart in mode analytics report (Refer Query1 for the results in table format):
1) First chart in the Mode analytics report shows the count of users involved in various events. As shown in this chart, 
the number of users making use of search_click_result_X are lesser than the count of users involved in other events. 
2) Also, the search_click_result_2 has more count than search_click_result_1. In such cases, it is better to show the 
search_click_result_2 at the top of the list. i.e. search_click_results should be displayed in the order of user preferences. 
Search_click_results with more user count will be at the top of the list and the ones with less count will be displayed at the 
bottom of the list
3) Also as per the chart, less number of users are running the search "search_run" when relatively compared with other engagement 
events. Count of Search click results are much lesser than other engagement/signup_flow events. This clearly indicates a need
to improve the search functionality and the mode of displaying the results.

Second Chart in mode analytics report (Apart from Pivot table, Query2 displays tabular results):
1) Second chart shows the various devices accessing the SEARCH functionality and the count of their devices. A pivot table displays the number of devices accessing various events.
2) On analysing the chart and the pivot tables, it can be concluded that count of users working on desktops/laptops and using the "search" functionality is more than that of the the users accessing search using mobile phones. This conveys the fact that improvements should be made on the mobile view of search functionality so that more users access the SEARCH using their mobiles.
3) Also, it can be seen that count of users with macbook pro is more than the count of users accessing the "search" using other devices.  Improvements can be made to make sure ease of access, compatibility is the same across devices.

*****************************************************************************************************
Third Chart in mode analytics report (Query3 displays tabular results):
This chart displays the count of unique users and count of companies making use of various events.
1) Although a number of users are making use of "Auto-Complete" feature, the number of users/companies using the "Search_run" and "search_click_result_x" are very less compared to other events.
2) Trends in this chart suggests the need to improve the search results in particular.
